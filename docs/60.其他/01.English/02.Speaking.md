part1 🌟

1. Did the author study some cases in the article to determine this architecture. 
2. What does the author want to express in this text

part2 🌟

Hello, everyone.

Today, my text topic is autonomous/ɔːˈtɒnəməs/ vehicles and embedded_  
/ɪm'bedɪd/ artifical intelligence :The challenges of framing machine driving decisions
The article published in 2019 and the Information is reliable.


Autonomous driving brings social benefits, also carry some potential risks.
we need to frame the av decisions.

There are 2 main factors impact on the decison capacity of AI, which is safety argument and the ethical challenge.

I will focus on safety and ethic of autonomous vehicle.

1st
Although safety arugments is important to us and still have some problems, even we have some shoratages in data or researches
safety is one part of the av dicisions, we can take it into consideration, it cannot completely define automous vehical
 
2nd
the ethical challenges
now we still have ethical limitaion in society, such as the classic case trolley trɒli  dɪˈlemə. dilemma

The morality of mechine should not based on human ethic and value, we could not use the same morality build a new model to set 

In conclusion, framing av decision is compelx and is full of debates
we need to combinate these factors to build the frame of av.


part3 🌟
Question 1: You mentioned five discussions about the roadmap, which five areas are they?
Question 2: I remember you mentioned providing training in ethics and responsible innovation, I would like to ask who is this training being provided for?


part4 🌟
1.Is there any problems with safty argument?
there is no doubt that the self-driving will solve some distaction or fatigue of a driver，but it also bring some new accident problems

such as sensor error, programming bugs, unanticipated objects, classification error, and hardware faults.

alth the possiblity of them are small but they ara fatal to people.

2.Could you talk more detail information about the ethical challenge ?
in current, programming automous intelligent mechines identify , process and carry out decisions are still hard to apply human values and ethics

Also human ethicis have ethical limiation 
certain programming shoud be silimar with driving laws,codes social nomal
some people hold that the moral can be programming into machine intelligence
morality code


Question 1: You mentioned five discussions about the roadmap, which five areas are they?
Question 2: I remember you mentioned providing training in ethics and responsible innovation, I would like to ask who is this training being provided for?

a.What are the concerns regarding ethics in AI?

decision ai system，Personal privacy can be overcollected
Every netizen's information will be leaked and misappropriated
It may violate human rights，security cannot be guaranteed at present


b. What are the implications for autonomous machine learning?
reduce the recyle labor，
Can reduce the complex cycle of meaningless manual labor
May reduce the likelihood that some researchers will find future results

c.Will machines make better ethical decisions than humans?
intoxication, distraction, fatigue, and poor behavioural decisions such as speeding
i am not sure.
collect data to draw the decisions but 
Human morality cannot be expressed in code
moral pricinples not based on human decision

3.主题部分

4.结束
Thank you for listening 
And now if there are many questions, I would be pleased to answer them
Thank you for your attention,
That’s an interesting question, I don’t know off the top of my head, but I’ll try to get back to you later with an answer

5.Q&A

## Simulation (day 5)

### 1.Background

```
The tiny independent island republic of Givania has recently been awarded £170 million pounds by 
the European Commission (EC) to make much needed improvements to the island’s infrastructure 
after being hit by a small earthquake several months ago. 
Much damage was done to several important sights on the island which require rebuild and or repair.
The island relies on summer tourism 
and is also an area of natural beauty with many rare bird and fish species that are endangered.
The money needs to be well spent to help secure its long-term future. 
Several applications have been received asking for money to help fund projects.
Now the Government has set up a commission to decide 
how the money will be spent and what money if any will be given to each project.
```

![](../../img/islandbackground.png)
```
Area: 630 km2 
Population: 250,000
Capital: Marvin’s Bay
Climate:  Tropical
Unemployment rate:  13.5 %
Main Industry:  Tourism 70% of the economy
```

::: details 详情

**Tommy Traveller, project leader for Givania Tourist Board**

```
You want money to invest for improving the Golf Club at Monty’s beach and the Sea Scape theme park, both popular tourist attractions. 

Sea Scape in Marvin’s Bay requires urgent repairs to its swimming pool and water slide.
The park is extremely popular with holidaying families and the owner, Barry Kuda, will match the amount of money awarded for the upgrade, pound for pound.  

The golf club needs new facilities, including the club with shops and restaurants, and proposed 5-star spa hotel for wealthier tourists. 
The course requires improvements to become an official tournament venue, which will attract wealthier visitors. 
This will involve joint funding with the golf resort owner Mr Ty Gerwoods. 

You also want money to invest for developing and upgrading the current facility to a bigger and more modern airport to meet increased levels of tourism.  
There is currently very poor internet connection and shopping facilities at the airport which is also looking run-down having its last upgrade in 1991.  
The runway also needs repaired as many airlines are complaining of both the financial and time costs caused by having to make repairs due to their aircraft because of the uneven runway surface. 

1. You want £95million for these projects
2. Decide how much money you want for each part of the project (The gold resort is a joint investment) and what benefits these projects will bring to the island

Confirming understanding when listening

1. So what you’re saying is……
2. So in your view……..
3. If I understand you correctly………

Checking understanding when speaking

1. Do you understand what I mean?
   Do you follow what I am saying?
   Am I making sense to you?

Showing you do not understand

1. I’m not sure I understand what you mean
2. I don’t quite follow you.  Could you explain that again?
3. Could you repeat that?
