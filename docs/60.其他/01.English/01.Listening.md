Day 1 Lesson B Summary Paragraph 1:Listening: 
Seven Principles of building better cities As building cities for three billion dwellers, the way we shape cities concerns humanity and climate change. Facing land consumption, greenhouse gas, vehicles miles traveled, health care, household costs, Los Angeles has taken efficient effects to transform itself into a transit-oriented environment. Seven principles dealing with sprawl for any density city are preserve environment, mix, walk, bike, connect, ride and focus. California, the United States and China have adopted the principles and get great changes, the case in point is Chongqin. The author’s purpose is to make people know what is a great city and how to shape it.

Day 2 Lesson B Summary Paragraph 2: Reading: 
Defining and Measuring Urban Sustainability in Europe, Implications and Conclusions To rank urban sustainability, the authors apply the Delphi method to define and measure cities in Europe. And The rankings of city may be useful for urban planning and development. The experiments searched 419 expert samples from various sources, developed three rounds of the questionnaire, and analyzed indications that may be limitations. Through three-round Delphi study, seven components are most related to the study and selected to measure and define the environmental dimension of urban sustainability (air quality, governance, energy consumption, non-car transportation infrastructure, green spaces, inequality, and CO2 emissions). The result may serve framework to define and operationalize urban environmental sustainability.

· You have used topic specific vocabulary in both paragraphs to show familiarity with the subject
· Topic sentences/conclusion sentences under-developed in both paragraphs. Avoid simplistic phrases “get great changes

Speakers can persuade an audience of their opinion by appealing to logic, ethos and pathos.

Logic involves providing a reasoned argument, i.e., one which appears to be well considered and which acknowledges the opposite view, but nonetheless, strongly affirms the speaker’s ideas. 

Ethos relates to the degree to which the speaker is seen as trustworthy or credible. This can be seen through their qualifications, experience, and knowledge as well as their confidence as a presenter. It can also be illustrated through the use of evidence, e.g., statistics to support a claim.

Pathos relates to appealing to people’s emotions. It is difficult to persuade people to adopt an idea or change behaviour without engaging their feelings. Pathos can include appealing to people’s desire to be good or to their fears.
