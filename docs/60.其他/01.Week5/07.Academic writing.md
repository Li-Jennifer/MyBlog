对学术剽窃说❌

>o Read and re-read the original text so that you understand the meaning.
>
>o Try expressing the ideas out loud, without looking at the original, and then write it down.
>
>o Try making notes of the **main ideas** by highlighting the keywords and writing your paraphrase from the notes only. 
>
>​	\- Keep the important content/concept words.
>
>o Find **synonyms** to replace the original words
>
>o Play around with the **grammar, lexis and Word Class.**
>
>​	\- Change nouns to verbs or verbs to nouns and see how that affects the structure.
>
>​	\- Use synonyms
>
>o Try **re-ordering the information** (but be sure to keep the same meaning)
>



::: details Example 

**Original**	

Ecological urbanism shares several concepts, ideas, and visions with green urbanism in terms of the role of the city and positive planning and development in shaping better places, communities, and lifestyles. 

**Paraphrase**	

Bibri (2020) suggests that regarding city planning and the creation of liveable cities with strong communities, **ecological** and **green urbanism** have similar underlying concepts, principles, and goals. (or a similar ideology)



o Keep keywords: Ecological urbanism PGreen urbanism PCity PPlanning

o Change: Share concepts, ideas…visions   →    **have similar principles and goals / ideology**                                              

o Change: shaping better places, and lifestyles  →  **creation of liveable cities** 

o Change: In terms of  →  **regarding**

o Change: the order of the information

## Synthesising texts (day 13)

### 1. Definition

Bringing together other authors’ ideas and combining them with your own, for a particular purpose

> * to establish the context
> * what’s known about the topic so far
> * compare / contrast views
> * critically respond to research findings

1. Have a clear purpose
2. Selecting quotes, summaries that can support your purpose
3. Using language that connects and links your ideas logically and smoothly
4. Citation of sources

### 2.How to Synthesise?

>1. Make notes using key points / key words
>
>2. Identify the relationships 
>3. Collate the source into groups -- similarities, differences.
>4. Consider your purpose
>5. Write your paragraphs, the ideas are logically connected
>6. Cite all the sources that you use.

### 3. Language

>Similarly, Smith (2019) **and** Chalmers (2020) found that….
>
>Smith (2019) argues that…..**Similarly**, Chalmers (2020)
>
>Smith (2010) states that…..**whilst** Jones (2016) points out that….
>
>Much of the literature focuses on recycling (Arran, 2017; Tobias and Smith, 2018), **with only a few examples** that focus on reuse (Arias 2010; Blank et.al., 2019)

## Reflection & Practice 

| Examine the paragraph                          |                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Is the purpose of the paragraph **clear?**     |                                                              |
| Is the structure of the paragraph **logical**? | Topic sentences<br/>Development<br/>Concluding Sentences     |
| Reasons for citing the source                  | 1. Eestablish the background context regarding the topic<br/>2. support a claim<br/>3. Establish a niche, i.e. a gap in the research<br/>4. Show contrasting views<br/>5. Show similar views <br/>6. Establish what previous research has shown |
| Use of the language to link the ideas?         | 1. Are there linking words to connect the ideas? <br>2. Have you integrated your own voice? |
| Citations                                      | Are the sources correctly cited?                             |
