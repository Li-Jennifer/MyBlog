## 1.File
 Display the following menu to the user:

1)Create a new file

2)Display the file

3)Add a new item to the file

Make a selection to 1, 2 or 3

Ask the user to enter 1, 2 or 3. If they select anything other than 1, 2 and 3, it should display a suitable error message.

If they select 1, ask the user to enter a school subject and save it to a new file called “Subjects.txt”. It should overwrite any existing file with a new file. If they select 2, display the contents of

“Subjects.txt” file. If they select 3, ask the user to enter a new subject and save it to the file and then display the entire content of the file.

Run the programmer several times to test the options.
```python
print("1) Create a new file") 
print("2) Display the file")
print("3) Add a new item to the file")

selection = int(input("Make a selection 1, 2 or 3: m3)
if selection == 1:
	subject = input("Enter a school subject: ")
	file = open("Subject.txt", "w")
	file.write(subject + "\n")
	file.close()
elif selection == 2:
	file = open("Subject.txt", "r")
	print(file.read())
elif selection == 3:
	file = open("Subject.txt", "a")
	subject = input ("Enter a school subject: ”)
	file.write(subject + "In")
	file.close()
	file = open("Subject.txt", "r")
	print(file.read())
else:
	print("Invalid option")
```
## 2.maths quiz
Create a simple maths quiz that will ask the user for their name and then generate two random questions. Store their name, the questions that were asked, their answers and their final score in a .csv file. Whenever the program is run it should add to the csv file, and not overwrite anything
```python
import csv 
import random

score = 0
name = input("What is your name: ")

q1_num1=random.randint(10,50) 
q1_num2 =random.randint(10,50)

question1 = str(q1_num1) + "+" + str(q1_num2) +"=" 
ans1 = int(input(question1)) 
realans1 = q1_num1 + q1_num2 

if ans1 == realans1:
	score =score+1
	
q2_num1 = random.randint(10,50)
q2_num2 = random.randint(10,50)

question2 = str(q1_num1) + " +" + str(q2_num2) + " =" ans2=int(input(question2)) realans2 =q2 num1 +q2 num2 if ans2== realans2 = q2_num1 + q2_num2
score = score + 1

file = open("QuizScore.csv","a")
newrecord = name + "," + question1 + "," + 
	str(ans1) + "," + question2 + "," +
	str(ans2) + "," + str(score) + "\n"
file.write(str(newrecord))
```
